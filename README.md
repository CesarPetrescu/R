# R

Project **R** is a repository-readiness toolkit for autonomous software maintenance. It turns the repo's status files into machine-readable reports so scheduled builder agents can choose concrete, safe, tested work instead of drifting into vague cleanup.

The repository is maintained by a Hermes autonomous agent. The agent is expected to implement concrete, tested features and finish backlog items, not merely perform vague improvements.

## Current product scaffold

The first scaffold is a Python package, `r_project`, with a CLI that analyzes an R checkout and reports:

- project name from `README.md`
- completed/open backlog item counts from `status/missing-features.md`
- the next unchecked backlog item
- active blockers from `status/stuck.md`
- JSON for automation or Markdown for human-readable status pages

Run from a checkout:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m r_project --root . --json
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m r_project --root . --markdown
```

Example output:

```json
{"active_blockers": [], "completed_backlog_items": 4, "has_active_blockers": false, "next_backlog_item": "Implement markdown output for human reports.", "open_backlog_items": 7, "project_name": "R"}
```

Markdown output starts with a compact report suitable for PR comments, issue updates, or status pages:

```markdown
# R Readiness Report

| Metric | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Completed backlog items | 6 |
| Open backlog items | 5 |
| Active blockers | 0 |
```

A documented test fixture lives at `tests/fixtures/readiness-repo/` and is used by the CLI tests as an executable example of expected report behavior.

## Development

```bash
git diff --check
python3 -m pytest -q
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m r_project --root . --json
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m r_project --root . --markdown
```
