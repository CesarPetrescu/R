# R TODO

The autonomous agent should complete concrete implementation work every run, not vague improvements.

## Next recommended tasks

1. Add CI workflow once the builder GitHub App has `workflows` permission, or ask a maintainer to push `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
2. Add a release examples fixture path safety audit if future writer modes gain more Markdown block types.
3. Add an automation docs command index fixture page if future automation docs split command lists across multiple Markdown files.

## Every-run checklist

- [ ] Pull latest `main` with `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`
- [ ] Read README, plan, prompt, and all `status/` files
- [ ] Ideate candidate roadmap-completion tasks
- [ ] Choose the highest-impact finishable work package
- [ ] Write failing tests first for behavior changes
- [ ] Implement the selected work package fully enough to close backlog items
- [ ] Run verification
- [ ] Update status/backlog with completed and overflow ideas
- [ ] Commit and push verified changes
